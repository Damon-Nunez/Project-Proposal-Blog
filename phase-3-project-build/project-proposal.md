# Capstone Project Proposal

This exercise is designed to help you narrow the scope of your research down to a well-defined problem whose solution you can reasonably derive over the course of the next five to six weeks. 


## Project Team

## Research Area(s)
> What technical topic(s) are you planning to explore through this project?_

* Linking front-end to back-end

## Inspiration
When you really think about it. Writers these days don't have as much spotlight as before and the platform for pure writing creativity is no longer there. In a era of technology, people find their entertainment,wisdom, and instructions online, meaning books aren't as needed anymore when it comes to gaining information and because of that disregard, people with passions for writing and sharing stories with over fictional or non-fictional don't have a solid home to really share. All they have is small facebook and twitter communities but that's all.

## Action
Our group plans to make an online library to fuel those creative minds to share in a story sharing dedicated app. Users will be able to share their stories to the world in any genre and read and comment on other people's stories and leave a like if they enjoyed it. Users will also be able to make some money as well through buying other people's books if they choose to put it for a price. Users can communicate with other authors about whatever they desire as we are trying to not only promote a place of sharing but building community as well.

## Anticipated Technical Challenges
> Creating databases, linking backend to frontend, creating animations,
