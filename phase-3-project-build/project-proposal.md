## Project Team
* Damon 
* Pedro
* Elijah
  
## Research Area(s)
> What technical topic(s) are you planning to explore through this project?_
* Express
* Authentificaton and authorization
* MVC file structure


## Inspiration
There are a lack of writing outlets available for aspiring professional authors. With the lack of those outlets it also reduces the communities of authors in general. We aim to create a community of writers that can share their stories through this medium to people all across the globe.

## Action
We have decided to create an app for writers to build a community. Through this app writers will be able to write and post their stories as well as read other people's stories and have a conversation about it through comments. With these features this app will be able to create the community that writers are missing.
## Anticipated Technical Challenges
* Database creation
* updating a story
* Authentication and authorization
* Live updates for likes and comments
* Bookmark feature 
* CRUD on all features
