## Inspiration
There are a lack of writing outlets available for aspiring professional authors. With the lack of those outlets it also reduces the communities of authors in general. With no place to write and share there really isn't a community to be had. 
## Action
So we have decided to create an outlet for writers to not only be able to post stories, but also read other author's stories and even communicate with them on a personal basis through private messaging. By doing this we aim to create a community all across the world for the people that don't have one.
## Anticipated Technical Challenges
> Database creation
> updating a story
> Authentication and authorization
> Live updates for likes and comments
> Bookmark feature 
> CRUD on all features
